Digital HHZ is a project of students at the Herman-Hollerith-Zentrum in Böblingen. It revolves around the digital transformation of research and studies at HHZ.

In the first part of this project, a sensor and actor infrastructure is to be implemented which will record and evaluate IoT data, primarily concerning factors such as light and air quality which heavily impact the working and learning environment at HHZ. To this end, multiple sensors are connected via Arduino modules to a central instance of the Home Assistant software.
The second part of the project is the development of a mobile app as a central touchpoint between humans and the IoT environment. It will enable usage of the previously established infrastructure in various contexts, for example it will allow to remotely access the sensor infrastructure as well as consume IoT-related services.

The aspired benefit is a stronger external representation of HHZ as a leading institution concerned with digitization and the Internet of Things. Also, the Digital HHZ is supposed to support both research projects and lectures at the institution.
